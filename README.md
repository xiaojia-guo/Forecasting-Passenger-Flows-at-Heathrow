# Code for Forecasting Passenger Flows at Heathrow

This code is used in our paper "Forecasting Airport Passenger Flows Using Real-Time Data and Machine Learning". In collaboration with Heathrow airport, we develop a predictive system that generates quantile forecasts of transferring passengers' connection times. Sampling from the distribution of individual passengers' connection times, the system also produces quantile forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the immigrating and security areas.

The predictive model developed is based on a regression tree combined with copula-based simulations. We generalize the tree method to predict complete distributions, moving beyond point forecasts.
